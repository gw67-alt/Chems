# Crude Synthesis of NeuroFlux-7

## Starting Materials
- L-Proline
- Piperonal (3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde)
- Methanesulfonyl chloride
- 4-Fluorobenzoyl chloride
- Common solvents and reagents

## Quick and Dirty Synthesis

### Step 1: Make the pyrrolidine base
1. Mix L-proline (50g) with piperonal (60g) in methanol (200mL)
2. Add sodium hydroxide (20g) dissolved in water (50mL)
3. Heat mixture to reflux for 6 hours
4. Cool, filter precipitate, wash with cold water
5. Dry crude product under vacuum - don't bother purifying

### Step 2: Add the methylsulfonyl group
1. Dissolve crude product from Step 1 (40g) in acetone (300mL)
2. Add potassium carbonate (30g)
3. Slowly add methanesulfonyl chloride (30mL) - mixture will get hot
4. Stir vigorously for 4 hours at room temperature
5. Pour into ice water (500mL), collect precipitate by filtration
6. Air dry the solid - no need for column chromatography

### Step 3: Add the fluorinated benzamide group
1. Mix crude product from Step 2 (25g) with 4-fluorobenzoyl chloride (25mL) in dichloromethane (200mL)
2. Add triethylamine (30mL) all at once - expect heat and fumes
3. Stir overnight at room temperature
4. Pour into water (300mL), separate organic layer
5. Evaporate solvent using a hot plate in fume hood
6. Crush resulting solid and wash with diethyl ether
7. Air dry to get crude NeuroFlux-7

## Purification (Minimal)
1. Dissolve crude product in minimum hot ethanol
2. Add water until cloudiness persists
3. Refrigerate overnight
4. Filter crystals and air dry

## Quality Check
Melting point should be around 145-155Â°C.
If it dissolves in DMSO, it's probably good enough.

## Yield
Expect 10-15g of impure product (about 20-30% yield).

## Note
This crude method prioritizes speed over purity or yield. The final product will contain impurities and may have reduced effectiveness. This synthesis description is provided for theoretical purposes only.
